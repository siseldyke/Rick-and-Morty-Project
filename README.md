Rick and Morty API

create a functioning search bar for assorted characters

show images, character stats, assorted facts

show list of episodes characters are in(ended up being a push for the api setup)

push goals:

**make previous, next character button(s)**(got it)

**random rick and morty sound button**(tried, deleted code to handle other matters)

**possibly effects on prev/next buttons**(somewhat accomplished)

**make background chang based on location** (fiddles for a little bit but abandoned)

**make a random character button**(did not get to)
